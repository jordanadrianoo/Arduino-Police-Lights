# Arduino-Police-Lights

This Arduino based project will focus on replicating police lights patterns using 4 LEDs. Hard coded light patterns will cycle in a malleable order. In addition, a servo will also play a range of pitches to replicate a police siren.

 **Prerequisites:**
 
 - Arduino Uno
  - USB type B
  - Breadboard
  - Jumper Wires
  - 2x Red LEDs
  - 2x Blue LEDs
  - 4x 220 OHM Resistor
